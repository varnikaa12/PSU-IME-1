# PSU-IME-1

The Harold & Inge Marcus Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering at The Pennsylvania
State University is launching a new course in industrial automation and robotics. They are seeking a low-
cost, open-source, and modular tabletop training platform that supports hands-on learning in industrial
control systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), system integration, and digital twins while
currently lacking an affordable, modular physical platform for lab instruction. The department's existing
commercial training devices provide strong functionality but are too expensive, closed, and difficult to
modify or repair, limiting their suitability for long-term academic use and iterative student prototyping.
The student team will design and prototype an MVP tabletop production cell that sorts small colored
cylinders representing workpieces in a manufacturing line. Key requirements include modular and
reconfigurable mechanical design, predominantly 3D-printed or easily fabricated components, low
assembly complexity, 24V PLC compatibility using ladder logic via OpenPLC on RevPi hardware,
minimized custom electronics, and sourcing of all major components from established suppliers. In-scope
activities include mechanical design using primarily 3D-printed components, integration of 24 V
electrical hardware aligned with IEC 61131-2/3, PLC-based control logic, industrial sensor integration,
and development of a digital twin in ProtoTwin. Stretch goals include multi-size LEGO sorting, a bulk
hopper with automatic singulation, and interoperability with other tabletop cells to create an end-to-end
automated workflow.
Core deliverables include: (1) a working physical prototype suitable for classroom demonstrations, (2)
complete open-source documentation including CAD, bill of materials, assembly drawings, wiring
diagrams, and source code, and (3) a validated ProtoTwin model of the system. Key budget requirements
include a target build cost of approximately $100 per unit with an absolute maximum of $500. Expected
benefits include substantial cost reduction relative to commercial trainers, improved instructional quality
through hands-on interaction with industrial hardware, reduced setup and maintenance effort, and a
flexible open-source platform that future cohorts can modify, repair, and extend. The project is planned
for 15 weeks, starting January 12th and ending by May 3rd with the Capstone Showcase and Program
Closeout Review.
